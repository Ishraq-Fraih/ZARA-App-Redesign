📱 ZARA App Redesign – Human-Computer Interaction Project
🚀 Project Overview:
This project focuses on redesigning the ZARA mobile application to enhance the user experience (UX) and improve usability. The study was conducted as part of CSCE242 - Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Hail. The redesign process was based on user feedback, identifying key issues, and applying User-Centered Design (UCD) principles.

🔹 Key Problems Identified:
1️⃣ Lack of Guidance – Users struggle to navigate the app and understand how to place orders.
2️⃣ Inconsistent Design – Poor menu organization and lack of product availability indicators.
3️⃣ Difficult Navigation – Users find it hard to search for products efficiently.

🔹 Our Solution & Redesign Process:
✅ Conducted a survey with 20 participants to analyze user frustrations.
✅ Applied a two-stage prototyping approach:

Low-Fidelity Prototype (Wireframes) to test initial concepts.
High-Fidelity Prototype using Figma for the final interactive design.
✅ Improvements implemented:
Added app guidance and tutorial for new users.
Introduced a serial number system for easier product searches.
Enhanced menu design, product availability status, and shopping cart warnings.
🔧 Technologies & Methods Used:

User Research (Surveys & Feedback Analysis)
Wireframing & Prototyping (Figma)
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Principles
Usability Testing & Evaluation
🎯 Future Enhancements:
🔹 Implement an AI-based recommendation system to suggest products based on user preferences.
🔹 Introduce a voice search feature to improve accessibility.
🔹 Improve checkout and payment UX for a seamless shopping experience.
